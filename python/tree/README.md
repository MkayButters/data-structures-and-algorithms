# Trees

Create classes and methods to experiment with trees.


## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a BinaryTree class
    - Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
    - Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capturable errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

- Create a BinarySearchTree class
    - Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    - Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
## Approach & Efficiency
Build an understanding of the problem domain and slowly create MVP.  The big O is O(n)

## API

- A method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

- A method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

- A method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
