# Challenge Summary
Work together as a team to build an understanding of the code challenge and determine what code/tests we need to implament to successfully complete the feature tasks.

## Challenge Description

- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

- Implement the following methods:
    - enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
    - dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency

 The approach we took is to get and understanding of what we needed to do and code it out. The big O is O(n)
