# Graphs

Build out logic and testing to make a graph.


## Challenge

Implement my own Graph. Create Tests to validate definition functions.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


## API

1. AddNode()

    - Adds a new node to the graph
    - Takes in the value of that node
    - Returns the added node


2. AddEdge()

    - Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
    - Include the ability to have a “weight”
    - Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
    - Both nodes should already be in the Graph


3. GetNodes()

    - Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)


4. GetNeighbors()

    - Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
    - Takes in a given node
    - Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection


5. Size()

    - Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
