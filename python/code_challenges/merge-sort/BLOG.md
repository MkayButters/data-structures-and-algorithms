## Merge Sort

1. First the merge sort definition will run through a list of numbers and split it in two temporary lists.

2. Takes those two lists and keeps spiliting them into 2 lists until there is only 1 number in the list

3. Then it merges, compares the left in right, and sorts it. Then puts it back into the list

4. Then step three is repeated with another but the 2 coming into the original list are compared to the numbers in the list coming in and is split and sorted and merged again but into a longer list with 4.

5. This process is repeated until the orginal list is the same length as it started with and the numbers will be all sorted.
